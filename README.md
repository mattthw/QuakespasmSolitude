# Solitude

> ⚠️ **NOTICE #1:** I am looking for the QC quake code source files to [Halo Revamped](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_GB9LLBATQ) (r17?) for N3DS! Without this, the changes I am able to make are extremely limited. If you happen to have this laying around on your computer or know someone who has this, please let me know.

> ⚠️ **NOTICE #2:** This port is starting from scratch. See the original release [here](https://github.com/mattthw/SolitudeVita). The old version was built ontop of vitaQuake. While this new version is built ontop of Quakespasm-spiked.
## Introduction
QuakespasmSolitude is a port of Solitude for the vita, built ontop of Quakespasm-spiked (a Quake engine ported to Vita by Rinnegatamante). Solitude was originally made for the PSP and released in 2010 by FlamingIce. The forums went down and the game & assets became shareware. Since then several projects started with a goal of releasing on new platforms or improving the base game. This port is still a work in progress. QuakeC code is blocked, unless someone is able to decompile it into a clean, workable state.

The goal of this project is to:
1. Have fun.
2. Make Solitude on PS Vita be a game we actually enjoy playing. Not just a demo of what is possible. 
3. Upgrade old PSP maps and create new maps. I want to have a solid map pack of maps we actually enjoy playing on.

# Installation on Playstation Vita
> **NOTICE:** This game is not yet released. Consider these instructons for developers at this point in time.
1. Download the latest release: [releases](https://github.com/mattthw/QuakespasmSolitude/releases/)
1. Extract the archive
1. Install ``quakehalo.vpk`` on the Playstation Vita
1. Copy the ```/Solitude``` folder to ```<ux0 or alternative:>/data/Quakespasm/```.
    - You will also need the original quake files or shareware files as a .PAK filetype inside ```<ux0 or alternative:>/data/Quake/id1/```. You should be able to use the data files from VITADB for vitaQuake.


The end result will look something like this:
```
/data/Quakespasm/
            ./id1/*.PAK  # Legally acquired PAK files from original quake game
            ./Solitude/*
```

# Development

## Editing & Compiling Quake

### QuakeC Code

Use [FTEQCC](https://www.fteqcc.org/) ([mac](https://github.com/BryanHaley/fteqcc-mac)) to compile or decompile QuakeC code.

Sorry, but unless someone wants to decompile the progs.dat, or if someone can get TCPixel to locate the source of Solitude Revamped R17, we are out of luck.
### Compile SolitudeVita
1. Install the VitaSDK and set up building with the instructions here; https://vitasdk.org/
2. Install VitaGL (https://github.com/Rinnegatamante/vitaGl) with "make" then "make install"
3. Run the following command in this repository's ``./Quake/`` directory, which should produce a working quakehalo.vpk
```make clean && make -f Makefile.vita && curl```
4. (Optional) After installing quakehalo.vpk for the first time, you can install the changes faster by enabling FTP on the vita then running:
```curl --ftp-method nocwd -T ./build/eboot.bin ftp://<local IP of your vita>:1337/ux0:/app/SOLITUDE0/```

## Mapping / Level Design

### WADs, Assets, Tooling
- [Skyboxes](https://www.quaddicted.com/webarchive/kell.quaddicted.com/skyboxes.html)
  - extract using [SLADE](https://slade.mancubus.net/index.php?page=downloads)
  - place all 6 images under <mod>/gfx/env/. If they are called skybox-day_[left | right | etc].tga then set ``sky`` to ``skybox-day_`` in trenchbroom's worldspawn entity.
- [Download WAD pack for map editing](https://github.com/mattthw/QuakespasmSolitude/releases?q=wad&expanded=true)
  - Use [Wally](https://valvedev.info/tools/wally/) to edit textures and build/package/unpackage the WAD
- [Quake Level Design Starter Kit](https://github.com/jonathanlinat/quake-leveldesign-starterkit#readme)
  - [Trenchbroom](https://github.com/TrenchBroom/TrenchBroom/releases)
  - [Quakespasm](https://sourceforge.net/projects/quakespasm/), [alt  silicon build](https://github.com/BryanHaley/Quakespasm-AppleSilicon)
  - [ericw-tools](https://github.com/ericwa/ericw-tools)
    >**NOTE** ericw-tools did not build for me on macOS 12.1 (Silicon). The issue was resolved by changing the build script: https://github.com/ericwa/ericw-tools/issues/329
  - [quake-cli-tools](https://github.com/joshuaskelly/quake-cli-tools): used for managing WADs
- For decompilation of maps, use **[WinBSPC](https://gamebanana.com/tools/download/5030)**

### General Workflow (macOS Silicon)
> Note: you must launch trenchbroom from the terminal with command ``cd /Applications/TrenchBroom.app && ./Contents/MacOS/TrenchBroom``. Otherwise the compilation tools will fail. This is because they rely on terminal variables.
1. Install [Quakespasm](https://sourceforge.net/projects/quakespasm/), [alt  silicon build](https://github.com/BryanHaley/Quakespasm-AppleSilicon) to some location
   1. Make sure to add ```./id1/``` and ``pak1.pak`` to ``<your game directory>/Quake/id1/``. I cannot provide pak1.pak, you can get it from Quake source code by purchasing a retail copy.
2. Create a folder inside ``Quakespasm`` called ``./maps/`` if it does not yet exist. This is where Quake looks for maps.
3. Create a folder inside ``Quakespasm`` called ``./working/``. This is where we will create/edit/save maps
4. Create ``wads`` folder in ``Quakespasm/working/wads`` and add [project wads](https://github.com/mattthw/QuakespasmSolitude/releases?q=wad&expanded=true). These are used by TrenchBroom to load textures
5. Install [ericw-tools](https://github.com/ericwa/ericw-tools) in ``Quakespasm/working/``
6. Setup **TrenchBroom**
   1. Go to preferences and click on *Quake 1*
      1. point the engine to the ``./Quakespasm/`` directory which contains ``./id1/maps/``, ``./working/`` etc.
   2. In the map editor, go to **Faces**, then at the bottom right click on *Texture Collections*. Add wads from ``Quakespasm/working/wads``.
   3. Edit and save your map
   4. Go to *Run -> Compile Map...*. 
      1. Use the following settings:
         - Working directory: ``${GAME_DIR_PATH}/working/``
         - Export Map: ``${WORK_DIR_PATH}/${MAP_BASE_NAME}.map``
         - Run Tool: ``${WORK_DIR_PATH}/ericw-tools/build/qbsp/qbsp``
           - Parameters: ``-wadpath  ${WORK_DIR_PATH}/wads/ ${MAP_BASE_NAME}``
         - Run Tool: ``${WORK_DIR_PATH}/ericw-tools/build/vis/vis``
           - Parameters: ``${MAP_BASE_NAME}``
         - Run Tool: ``${WORK_DIR_PATH}/ericw-tools/build/light/light``
             - Parameters: ``<your settings> ${MAP_BASE_NAME}``
               - example ``-bounce -bouncescale 2 ${MAP_BASE_NAME}``
               - docs: http://ericwa.github.io/ericw-tools/doc/light.html
               - examples: http://ericwa.github.io/ericw-tools/
         - Copy Files: source: ``${WORK_DIR_PATH}/${MAP_BASE_NAME}.bsp``, target: ``${GAME_DIR_PATH}/id1/maps/``
         - Copy Files: source: ``${WORK_DIR_PATH}/${MAP_BASE_NAME}.lit``, target: ``${GAME_DIR_PATH}/id1/maps/``
      2. Click *Launch...*
         1. use the parameters ``-basedir ${GAME_DIR_PATH} +map ${MAP_BASE_NAME} ``
